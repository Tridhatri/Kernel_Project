# Kernel_Project
Developed a bootable kernel with memory management, process scheduling, and system calls in under 1000 lines of C and Assembly. Designed a basic shell interface for user interaction and command execution. Implemented paging and segmentation for memory protection and used QEMU for testing and debugging low-level OS components.
